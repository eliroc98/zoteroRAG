# Example 3: Combining preset with custom overrides
# questions:
#   - question: "How does attention work?"

#       qa_score_threshold: 0.05  # From methodology preset
#       max_answer_length: 300     # Custom: even longer answers
# retrieval_threshold (0.1-10.0)
#   - L2 distance threshold for initial FAISS retrieval
#   - Lower = stricter (fewer, more similar paragraphs)
#   - Higher = more lenient (more paragraphs retrieved)
#   - Typical: 1.5-3.0
#   - Use higher (2.5) for exploratory questions (methodology, explanation)
#   - Use lower (2.0) for specific questions (factoid, comparison)

# rerank_threshold (0-1)
#   - Minimum CrossEncoder score to keep candidates
#   - Lower = more lenient (keep more candidates for QA)
#   - Higher = stricter (only keep highly relevant)
#   - Typical: 0.15-0.30
#   - Use lower (0.20) for broad questions needing context
#   - Use higher (0.25) for focused questions

#       min_answer_words: 5
#       prefer_entities: false
#       priority_sections:         # Custom sections
